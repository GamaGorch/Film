          <p> The documentary I watched was called “Jeen-Yuhs” and is directed by the film duo Coodie and Chike. The documentary follows legendary hip hop artist Kanye west through his greatest highs and lowest lows. It started off as early as 2004 following Kanye as he is producing his debut album “The College Dropout.” The movie's main character is Kanye as he has a larger than life personality that revolves around his overwhelming confidence in himself and his art. One of the main supporting characters at the beginning of the film is Donda West, the mother of Kanye. Donda is shown to be Kanye’s anchor and helps keep him grounded. She also shows a tremendous amount of confidence in her son and this clearly can be seen through their interactions. The next supporting character is the cameraman and director Coodie. He helps pace the film through his narration and recapping of events. He follows Kanye through many important milestones and captures it all on film. The documentary is split up into three parts that are separated by the rise, the fall, and the epilogue. A key turning point is the death of Kanye's mother. We see the hero of the film, Kanye, slowly start to morph into a more villainous role with clips of his outbursts to the media and to close friends. We see a portion in his life in which he completely cuts off Coodie and we have to see the life of Kanye through viral media coverage of his antics. The film only reaches its third act when the two come together again to continue the documentary. Here we see a small redemption arc for Kanye as he begins to focus on making music again as well as work on fashion and philanthropy. The film is sharply edited and goes through more than a decade's worth of film to create a concise narrative of one of the most influential pop culture icons.
